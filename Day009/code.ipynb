    "* Inheritance - Inheritance allows classes to inherit data member and methods from another class. The class from which all the inheritance happens is called parent class or base class and the class inheriting is called child class.\n",

    "* Abstraction - The Programmer need not handle all the complexity of implementation of different set of methods. Rather apis are provided to call the methods where they do a specific job. Only the call signature and return types are to be handled by programmer. API takes care of the implementation.\n",
